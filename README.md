# AlphaFight
## Game made with Godot where you fight letters with letters.
------------------------------------------
### Concept
- You start with the word "nothing" (therefore fitting the theme)
- With these letters you can then fight other AI controlled letters 
- You can capture them and with them grow your army
- all groups of letters form (initially) words/sentences
- the more distance is between the spawn and you, the more populated the enemy's armys are
